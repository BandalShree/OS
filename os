Shell Scripting Practical Test Paper
Question 1          
Write a shell script that takes a filename as input and prints the number of lines, words, and characters in the file. Additionally, the script should prompt the user for a string and count the number of occurrences of that string in the file. Save the script as file_stats.sh and run it on a sample text file to verify that it works.

Question 2
Write a shell script that takes a directory name as input and recursively counts the number of files and directories inside the directory. Save the script as dir_stats.sh and run it on a sample directory to verify that it works.

Question 3
Write a shell script that takes a list of numbers as input and prints the sum of the numbers. Save the script as sum.sh and run it on a sample list of numbers to verify that it works.

Question 4
Write a shell script that takes a filename as input and replaces all occurrences of a word with another word. The script should prompt the user for the word to be replaced and the new word. Save the script as replace_word.sh and run it on a sample text file to verify that it works.

Question 5
Write a shell script that takes a filename as input and converts all text to lowercase. Additionally, the script should remove all punctuation marks. Save the script as word_count.sh and run it on a sample text file to verify that it works.

Question 6
Write a shell script that takes a string as input and checks whether the string is a palindrome. Save the script as palindrome.sh and run it on a sample string to verify that it works.

Question 7
Write a shell script that takes a filename as input and prints the number of times each word appears in the file, sorted by frequency. Save the script as word_count.sh and run it on a sample text file to verify that it works.
